          The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteen must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descripition of their ingridients help both student and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meals choice and any deitary they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated staff and student alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/ children's activities in the school, instantly. Once the student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps a school keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendence by logging in, and it is stored in database, which can later be checked in by Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their cirruculum's subjects. As soon as you enter student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud cababilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those who students fool their deans are caught in shorter span - just after the admin enter login detail into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institution as students and thier parents are pre-informed about the real time status of leave request and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.  </p>
